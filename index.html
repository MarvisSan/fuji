                    <p>Formation:
                        <br>
                        Ancient Origins: The story of Mount Fuji begins hundreds of thousands of years ago. Geological estimates suggest its formation started around 100,000 years back through a series of eruptions from multiple volcanoes.
                        Evolving Landscape: Over time, these eruptions gradually built upon each other, forming a more prominent and recognizable peak. The two predecessor volcanoes, Komitake and Older Fuji, eventually became buried beneath layers of lava and ash, contributing to the present-day Mount Fuji.
                        <br>
                    Volcanic Activity:
                    <br>
                        Active Past: Mount Fuji is classified as a dormant volcano, meaning it has erupted in the past but is not currently active. The last recorded eruption occurred between 1707 and 1708, leaving behind a layer of ash that reached as far as Tokyo.
                        Impact on Surroundings: Throughout history, volcanic activity from Mount Fuji has shaped the surrounding landscape. Volcanic ash deposits have enriched the soil, making it fertile for agriculture. However, eruptions have also caused destruction and displacement of settlements.
                        <br>
                    Cultural Significance:
                    <br>
                        Symbol of Japan: Mount Fuji holds immense cultural significance in Japan. Its majestic form, with its near-perfect symmetry, has inspired artists, poets, and writers for centuries. It's a revered symbol of beauty, nature, and resilience, often depicted in Japanese art forms like woodblock prints and paintings.
                        Religious Importance: Mount Fuji has also held religious significance for centuries. Many shrines and pilgrimage routes surround the mountain, and it's considered a sacred place by some Shinto and Buddhist traditions. Climbing Mount Fuji is viewed as a spiritual journey for some, signifying perseverance and connection with nature.
                        <br>
                    Modern Era:
                    <br>
                        Tourism and Preservation: Today, Mount Fuji remains a major tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to witness its beauty and experience the challenge of climbing to the summit. Balancing tourism with environmental preservation is a key concern, as preserving the natural beauty and cultural significance of Mount Fuji is paramount.</p>

                    <p>
                        The best time to visit Japan is during spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). This is when Japan is at its most vibrant, with delicate cherry blossom or bright red leaves adding contrast to the scenery. Remember, it can also be very crowded at this time.
                        <br>
                        The summer months (June to August) offer ideal conditions for hikers and lovers of the outdoors, but only in the mountains of the Japanese Alps and Hokkaido’s wild national parks. Elsewhere, the weather is hot and humid. Rainy season occurs from the end of May until the middle of June or July.
                        <br>
                        For a very different experience, head to the north of Japan in winter (December to February). It’s snowy, but the people brighten the dark days with a variety of festivals and events.
                        <br>
                        It’s a good idea to take Japan’s national holidays into account, too. Shogatsu (Japanese New Year), Obon (in mid-August or mid-July, depending on the area), and the Golden Week (between April 29 and May 5) are busy times for residents.

                    <h3><i class="bi bi-signpost"></i>Route</h3>
                    <p>There are four main routes up Mount Fuji which vary in popularity and difficulty.
                        Yoshida Trail. This is the most popular route taken by 70% of climbers. Good facilities at the start and many huts along the route.
                        Fujinomiya Trail. The second most trodden route after the Yoshida Trail. One shop and information office at the start of the trail. Descent is along the same route as the ascent which may lead to congestion.
                        Subashiri Trail. Starting station is not well developed. Meets the Yoshida Trail at the Old 8th Station hut. Harder then both the Yoshida Trail and Fujinomiya Trail.
                        Gotemba Trail. The longest and most difficult trail (starting point is 1,440m), but the Osunabashiri (“Great Sand Run”) down is one of the quickest, letting you descend in leaps and bounds for the small price of a boot full of sand. Very few huts along the trail (the first is at 3,000m). The Gotemba Trail is the most difficult of the four routes.
                    <br>
                    The Yoshida Trail is by far the most popular, especially among tourists and first-time climbers of the mountain. It is one of the easiest routes with shops and restaurants at the start, and many huts where you can purchase water, snacks, and hot food along the route to the summit. The rest of this post will be a guide to climbing via this trail, but much of the advice applies to the other routes, as well.</p>
